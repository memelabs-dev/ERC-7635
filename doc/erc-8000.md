## Abstract

This is the standard for Multi-Fungible Tokens (MFT). The provided document describes the smart contract interface set
that defines the ERC-721 compatible token standard. It also introduces a new transfer model and an approval model for
storing various types of assets.

MFT tokens include an ERC-721 equivalent ID property to identify themselves as unique entities, enabling MFT tokens to
be transferred between addresses and operated upon in an ERC-721 compatible manner.

MFT implements multiple slots to configure assets of types such as ERC-721, ERC-20, KEY, etc. Its core features include:

*MFT Management
**Flexible configuration of MFT transfer permissions, MFT types, and levels.
*Slot Management
**Flexible configuration of slot asset types, asset contract addresses, and transfer permissions.
*Asset Management
**Through slots, support storage and configuration of ERC-721, ERC-20, and KEY assets.
**Enable asset transfer between MFTs.
**Enable asset transfer between MFTs and EOA wallets.
**Flexible deposit and withdrawal of tokens in MFT.

Compatibility and Scalability
Fully compatible with the ERC-721 protocol, allowing free trading on decentralized exchanges.
This EIP introduces a new token model to achieve token multi-dimensionality, including the ability for the same MFT to
configure storage for multiple types of token assets, as well as value transfers between two assets within the same slot
and value transfers from tokens to addresses.

## Motivation

The essence of tokenization is how assets are encapsulated. Traditionally, there have been two methods used: fungible
tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC-721). These correspond to homogeneous assets and unique assets,
respectively. The former is similar to stocks or currencies, while the latter is similar to art collections or game
items.

However, there is an increasing need for encapsulating a wide variety of complex assets. The existing protocol standards
do not fully meet the requirements for encapsulating such assets.

For example, an account may hold multiple fungible assets such as USD, GBP, JPY, along with a credit account, insurance
or investment contracts, and loyalty points（KEY） from a bank. Alternatively, a game character may possess fungible
tokens within the game, various equipment items, and convertible game-specific loyalty point（KEY） assets that cannot be
directly traded but can be exchanged for corresponding game value.

To address similar requirements as mentioned above, protocols like ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-3525 are not
sufficient. The most effective approach is to create a multi-fungible token that combines the non-fungible
characteristics of ERC-721 with the ability to store and manage various custom assets such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and
loyalty points. It maintains an NFT's overall structure and can leverage existing NFT infrastructure.

OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-721 smart contracts . This allows your smart
contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your NFTs represent.

## Rationale

Each MFT on the Ethereum network has its unique properties. This EIP protocol, built upon ERC-721, introduces the
concept of slots for each MFT. Each slot can store a specific type of asset, and the number of slots can be increased by
depositing ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens into the contract.

Each MFT can act as a wallet to manage the slot assets associated with that MFT. These slot assets can be transferred to
other MFTs or Ethereum addresses. When an MFT is transferred to a new Ethereum address, the slot tokens it manages are
also transferred along with it, simplifying the asset migration process significantly.

**Approving Mechanism**

* This EIP provides additional slot authorization functionality in addition to being compatible with all authorization
  rules of ERC721:
    * `approve(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _slotIndex, address _operator, uint256 value_)`:
        * MUST revert if `_tokenId` is zero id or `_operator` is zero address.
        * MUST revert if `_operator` is the same owner as the MFT
        * An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT
    * For any approving function, the caller MUST be the owner or has been approved with a higher level of authority.

**Transfer Mechanism**

* The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _slotIndex,uint256 _value)` function, SHOULD
  indicate slot value transfers from one MFT to another MFT, in accordance with the rules below:

    * MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been
      approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
    * MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` or `_toTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
    * MUST revert if `_slotIndex`  is zero id or does not exist.
    * MUST revert if slots of `_fromTokenId` and `_toTokenId` do not match.
    * MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
    * MUST check for the `onMFTReceived` function if the owner of _toTokenId is a smart contract, if the function
      exists, MUST call this function after the value transfer, MUST revert if the result is not equal to `XXXXXXX`;
    * MUST emit `TransferValue` event.

* The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _slotIndex,uint256 _value)` function, which transfers
  ERC20 or ERC721 value from one token ID to an address, SHOULD follow the rule below:

    * MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been
      approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
    * MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
    * MUST revert if `_slotIndex`  is zero id or does not exist.
    * MUST revert if `_to` is zero address.
    * MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
    * MUST check for the `onMFTReceived` function if the _to address is a smart contract, if the function exists, MUST
      call this function after the value transfer, MUST revert if the result is not equal to `XXXXXXX`;
    * MUST emit `TransferValue` event.

**ERC-165 Interface**

We chose Standard Interface Detection (ERC-165) to expose the interfaces that a ERC-8000 smart contract supports.
